- **SQUAC**: An efficient and robust large-scale multiple testing method to infer high-dimensional gene co-expression networks based on sample-quantile contingency tables.
  - [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6497089/) [JSSSB, 2018]
  - [R codes](https://github.com/jichunxie/squac)

- **bcSeq**: This package implements a highly efficient data structure and algorithm for performing alignment of short reads from CRISPR or shRNA screens to reference barcode library. Sequencing error are considered and matching qualities are evaluated based on Phred scores. A Bayes' classifier is employed to predict the originating barcode of a read.

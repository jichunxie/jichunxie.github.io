# News

- [Jun. 20, 2024] Two recent publications by current and former lab members:
  - SifiNet: a robust and accurate method to identify feature gene sets and annotate cells. Available [here](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/9/e46/7655783). This paper develops a new pipeline to use gene co-expression graph topology to directly call feature genes, annotate cells, and study cell type transitions.
  - DYNATE: Localizing rare-variant association regions via multiple testing embedded in an aggregation tree. Available [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38014869/). This paper developes a new hierarchical aggregation method to call genic regions harboring disease-associated rare variants.
- [Feb. 19, 2024] Congratulations to Yuxia Xie, who have received the 2024 Duke Center for Human Systems Immunology (CHSI) Pilot Award.
- [Feb. 5, 2024] Congratulations to Jilin and Yaoyao -- both were admitted by multiple Ph.D. programs!
